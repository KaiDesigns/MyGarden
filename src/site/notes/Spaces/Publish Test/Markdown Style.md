**Diagram**

Obsidian uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) to render diagrams and charts . Mermaid also provides [a helpful live editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor).

```

	```mermaid
	sequenceDiagram
		Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
		Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
		John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
		John-->>-Alice: I feel great! 
	```
```
